# Music Recommendation Project
+ Our project's goal is to build a better music recommendation system through machine learning.


## General Plan
+ We will use data from KKBOX given by Kaggle, augmented by data from last.fm and the Million Song Dataset to accurately
predict whether a user will listen to a track a second time within a month of the first listening instance.
